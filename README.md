# Emotion-Detection-Using-DeepFace

This project leverages DeepFace, a cutting-edge deep learning framework, to perform emotion detection from facial images. By analyzing a still image of a famous actor, the model predicts the dominant emotion expressed in the photo, such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise.

Key Features

Deep Learning Framework: Utilizes DeepFace for robust emotion recognition.
Image Preprocessing: Converts images from BGR (OpenCV format) to RGB for accurate visualization.
Real-World Application: Demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to emotion recognition in images.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of deep learning models in detecting human emotions from visual data. This proof-of-concept project serves as an excellent example of leveraging pre-trained models for practical use cases.
